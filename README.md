# 4d-plugin-curl
This is a 4D plugin implementation of [libcurl and cURL](http://curl.haxx.se).

Important
---
This plugin project is a forked subset of what was published as [OAuth](https://github.com/miyako/4d-plugin-oauth).

Existing cURL@ commands have the same name and functionality, but their tokens (internal IDs) have changed.

To migrate existing methods, do the following:

1. Comment the code that calls cURL@ plugin commands.
2. Close 4DB.
3. Replace the plugin.
4. Uncomment the code.

Remarks
---
On Mac, SSH2 is linked to the system OpenSSL located at /usr/lib/, not the one embedded in the plugin. [This is to avoid crash with SFTP](http://forums.4d.fr/Post/FR/15200699/1/15251183).

LIBCURL is modified so that it will yield to 4D during a long operation (easy.c).
